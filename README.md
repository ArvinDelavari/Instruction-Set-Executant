# C++ Instruction Set Executant 

<div align="justify">
  
This code is a C++ class called `instruction_set` that defines a set of methods and member variables for executing instructions. The code is implemented as a part of an instruction execution (sample) system like a compiler where instructions are loaded, executed, and operands are manipulated based on the given type.

- The class `instruction_set` is defined with private member variables, including arrays `stack`, `main_memory`, `p`, `r`, and `code`, as well as scalar variables `ip`, `flags`, `sp`, and `codesize`.
- The public section of the class contains several method declarations, including `jump`, `compare`, `input`, `output`, `move`, `logic_and`, `logic_not`, `logic_xor`, `logic_or` and etc. These methods perform various operations on operands and modify the state of the instruction execution.
